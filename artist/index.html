            This is Hatsune Miku. She is very cool and her official code-name is CV01. She may not be real but Miku is a virtual idol.
            <p> As you can see she has two cool blue pigtails. Very cool.</p> 
                She is a part of a thing called Vocaloid but
            I don't know much about it.
            <p> I just like her hair and I think she looks kinda awesome. <3 </p>
